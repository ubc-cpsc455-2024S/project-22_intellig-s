# Group 22 - AI-tinerary

### Deploy Status: ![deploy workflow](https://github.com/ubc-cpsc455-2024S/project-22_intellig-s/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)

## Project Description

Our project is for travelers. From the absolute beginnners to the travel connoisseurs, our app is for anyone with wanderlust! Of course, you can never be too young or old to travel, so our app is perfectly suited for students, adults, parents, and even whole families.

Our app will allow users to browse different travel destinations. By collecting user data through in-app activity as well as periodic surveys, our app will make travel itinerary and destination suggestions based on a user's preferences via the power of AI.

In order to support this, the app will store user data including region whitelists, blacklists, temperature and transportation method preferences, as well as personal user information including names and emails.

If time permits, some additional functionality that we can add is the ability to create travel interaries for how to arrive to a destination, instead of just excursions while already there. Moreover, we can allow users to group their itineraries with other users if they are traveling together. On the other hand, if we are tight on time, we can remove the AI functionality altogether, and just have manual itinerary creation and destination tracking within our app.
